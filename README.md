# manikrathee/feedback

This is a quick little ask-me-anything type of repository.

I grabbed this repo after seeing [@holman](https://github.com/holman/) and [@mdo](https://github.com/mdo) put it to good use.

I'm a user experience engineer, user interface designer and frontend developer. Formerly a UX Engineer for [President Barack Obama](http://www.barackobama.com), I am now the Lead Designer for [Fluence](http://www.fluenceapp.com).

### Twitter

If you have something quick and easy, just ping me on Twitter. 140 characters
is often more than enough. [@manikrathee](https://twitter.com/manikrathee)
